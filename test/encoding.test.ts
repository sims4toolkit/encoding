/**
 * The encoder and decoder were created in August 2020, and have been used in
 * multiple projects since then, and have been functioning exactly as expected.
 * Unit tests for these classes is more of a nice-to-have, when I have the time
 * to write them, but for now, they are not a priority.
 * 
 * For your own assurance that these classes are functioning, you can check out
 * a demo at https://frankkmods.com/#/ts4-tools/stbl-editor, where they are
 * used to serialize and deserialize String Tables.
